Here is the converted text to a structured JSON format:

```
{
    "Contoso": {
        "Invoice": {
            "For": {
                "Company": "Microsoft",
                "Address": {
                    "Street": "1020 Enterprise Way",
                    "City": "Sunnayvale",
                    "State": "CA",
                    "Zip": "87659"
                }
            },
            "Other Address": {
                "Street": "1 Redmond way",
                "Suite": 6000,
                "City": "Redmond",
                "State": "WA"
            },
            "Invoice Details": [
                ["Invoice Number", "Invoice Date", "Invoice Due Date", "Charges", "VAT ID"],
                ["34278587", "6/18/2017", "6/24/2017", "$56,651.49", "PT"]
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Please note that I've assumed the VAT ID is not a numerical value and should be treated as text. If it's actually a numeric code, please let me know and I'll adjust the JSON accordingly.
